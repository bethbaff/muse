        <p>b. has worked in finance, politics, healthcare, policy, and business across the social, public, and private sectors and has always craved a way to provide color commentary on the world around her in a private forum (without getting caught). b. musings allows her to write honestly and openly about her observations - and strong P.O.V. across a wide range of topics that don't fit into any traditional boxes.

        <p>b. has worked in international development operations, journalism (Ugandan Journalist of the Year, ahem), climate change policy, political organizing, political communications, and policy analysis.  she joined b. musings to shout (loudly) to the world about the importance of action, policy, and regulation to curb the effects of climate change.
